**Features:**

1) Customizable
2) Open Source
3) Auto-Catch
4) Multiple Fishing Spots
5) Fully external

**How To Use:**

Fisherman has only been tested on a 1440p Monitor Running the game at 1920x1080

If you aren't using a realtek driver you will have to install VB Audio Cable. Sound has to be ran through VB Audio Cable or Stereo Mix. They will have to be set as default devices.

Multiple Audio sources will confuse the bot so turn down game music and turn off sounds for everything except albion.

The Bot will attempt a catch when the audio threshold goes over. This is an adjustable value.

You may have to adjust the area where the bot scans for the minigame. This is simple to do.

on line 60 there is start_x and start_y These values should be adjusted to the approximate point shown in the image.
(You can find screen coordinates using programs,etc)
